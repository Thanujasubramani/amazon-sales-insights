## 🧩 Business Problem
Amazon operates across multiple regions, categories, and customer segments. Raw sales data alone makes it difficult to:
- Identify high-performing products and regions
- Track profitability alongside sales
- Understand seasonal and regional trends
- Analyze customer payment and shipping preferences

This dashboard centralizes key metrics and insights into a single, easy-to-use analytical view.
